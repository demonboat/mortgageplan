# Codetest - Mortgage Plan

## Features
- Calculated the fixed monthly rate and apply it in the console.
- Validated all data in and out of the Application using simple checks to see if the data was somehow much bigger than anticipated or simply null.
- Laid it all on top of Spring Boot 3 & added OpenAPI 3 with Spring doc ui in order to get a dev view of the endpoints as well as being able to call them.
- There is no persistent storage except for the prospects file itself so any new entry will only be around as long as the application is running.
